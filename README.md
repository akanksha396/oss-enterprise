# Releasing Open Source

You want to release something as open source? Awesome! It's up to you to get it ready, but don't worry, you are never alone. Open a [new issue](issues/new?template=new-release.md) to get started. [Consider these questions as you start to open source the project.](docs/key-questions-for-choosing-projects.md)

## What should be open source?

It's easier to answer this question in terms of what should **not** be open sourced:

1. Don't open source anything that represents core business value.  If it makes us lots of money by being closed source, don't open source it.
2. Don't open source anything that is specific to internal processes. If it won't be useful to anyone that doesn't work here, don't open source it.
3. Don't open source anything you can't commit to maintaining long-term. Some projects are inherently difficult to maintain. If you don't want to spend time accepting contributions and working with the open source community, don't open source it.

## Open Source Maintainer Expectations

Before you open source your project, consider the effort required to maintain it. Being an great open source maintainer requires more effort than managing a closed source project. Read our [Maintainer Guide](docs/maintainers-guide.md) to understand what will be expected of you.

Assessment 2: answer the questions 


## Reflect on a README.md

#### Question 1 What is the purpose of this repository?

The purpose of this repository is that it is useful for other organizations. That is what a open source contribution is known for.

#### Question 2 Who should someone contact if they have questions?


The best possible way to get your answers is to post publicly. Greater the number of people greater the amount of idead will come out. 

#### Question 3  How should someone make contact if they have questions?

There should not be a different thread. The place where the curious has posted the question, right there should be the reply.

#### Question 4 What are the first steps to getting started open sourcing a project?

Before open sourcing a project, one should first ask themselves the purpose of their projects and in what way it can contribute to the society, should not feel judged as we learn from mistakes.

Generally speaking, you should open source your project when you feel comfortable having others view, and give feedback on, your work.
No matter which stage you decide to open source your project, every project should include the following documentation:

Open source license

README

Contributing guidelines

Code of conduct

As a maintainer, these components will help you communicate expectations, manage contributions, and protect everyone’s legal rights (including your own). They significantly increase your chances of having a positive experience.

If your project is on GitHub, putting these files in your root directory with the recommended filenames will help GitHub recognize and automatically surface them to your readers.

#### Question 5 How does this repository relate to other projects and business goals?

The main purpose of a repository is to store a set of files as well as the history of changes made to those files.

All users have write access to
Organizational repositories, which is granted by default Organization
permission with membership. Teams are used to group users by role
or area of expertise, not for granting them access to repositories.
This approach works best in small companies where everyone contributes
to multiple projects — startups are a great example of this work model.
The ideal candidate for this structure also has a high-trust environment
and a highly collaborative work model, as one of the biggest benefits of
this architecture is that all members and teams can be @mentioned to
get their input on all projects. As this is a loose organizational structure,
it doesn’t work well for companies with siloed business divisions.
